# hello! i'm jesse

i'm a programming enthusiast and have always enjoyed the chase of finding laborious tasks/processes and making a system to solve them. i have a background in making music and love going at anything that will allow the music and programming worlds to collide.

currently working on:
- operations development @ [givetel](https://github.com/Givetel) including web tools, apis and infrastructure.
- dsp research & design @ [australian technique](https://github.com/Australian-Technique) implementing embedded dsp for loudspeakers.

my go-to languages:
- python
- go
- javascript/typescript
- rust (although i don't own any thigh high socks, yet)

i've also built some pretty terrible projects in C and plan to build some even worse projects in zig.
