# hello! i'm jesse

i've been working in the charity fundraising industry for a few years, developing automation solutions for a telefundraising company in sydney.

i've enjoyed using the following tools in solutions i've built:
- python
- go
- rust
- javascript/typescript
- mysql

i've also used the following tools, and would use them again with heightened emotions/pain:
- aws (most experienced with lambda, ec2, api gateway, vpc, iam, sqs)

currently enjoying building outside of serverless infrastructures, but maintain projects hosted on vercel & apis built using api gateway/lambda.
